## Future Development / Ideas.

- One of the ideas for the menu was a drop down section with cards, where the tip of the carts are like tabs and when selected, the menu drops down underneth. 
- As a reply to show your message has been succesfully sent, we thought a modal could be put in place only to confirm the message is sent and that someone would get back to them when posible type of message.

# Testing

Although I like the stage where the site currently is, there are still several details that are not at 100% to how I imagine them to be. 
-	This Website was tested on Safari, Brave, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer.
-	The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad PRO, iPhone 12 & iPhone12 PRO.
-	A lot of testing was done to ensure that all of the links in the pages worked correctly.
-	Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues. 

Some of the issues I found during the testing once the code was placed on the validator:
- I was getting errors as I was using section tags withiut headings, so this oes where chaged to a div tag.
- On the menu section, I needed had initially added paragraphs and subheadings whithing the < li > items, I also had an < ul > nestes inside of another < ul >. this of course gave an error, so the < p > tags where moved inside of the < li >, and the nested < ul > was aded inside of a < li > whithing the main < ul >.

- Due to various mejor changes thorught out the development of this site, i ended with many lines of code not being needed anymore, but causing all sorts of trouble with the formaing of the existing code. so I had to go throught every single line several times, to ensure everything was correct.

- HTML Validator [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?showsource=yes&doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjorgekleiss.github.io%2Flos-gochos-restaurant)

- CSS Validator [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fjorgekleiss.github.io%2Flos-gochos-restaurant&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#warnings)

#### Known bugs
- On the gallery, when the hover over function is active, I wasnt able to thet the active image being hovered to cover the othernes while on hover. I tried using z-idex values, but this wasnt succesfull. TO BE IMPROVED!

- The navbar was mean to be on the top right hand courner, and despite the man attepmts usign flexbox to move it, I just could not get it to work and be where I wanted.
